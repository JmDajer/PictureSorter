# How to use
1. Build the project or just run it from CLI or IDE.
2. Pick a folder where the pictures are that you want to sort into other folders.
3. Pick a folder where the sorted files will end up in their corresponding dated folders.

# How does it work
It works by using the Date Taken attribute of files to sort them into their own folder.
Each folder will have the Date Taken as the name and in those folder will be only files with that date.
It only copy and pastes the files, instead of moving them. This is more of an assurance that the original files won't dissapear.
